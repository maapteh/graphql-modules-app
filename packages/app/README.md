# NextJS Apollo GraphQL

## Introduction
This simple application is created to show the complete setup of an Apollo GraphQL endpoint (see '../server') created with GraphQL-Modules, with this isomorphic application consuming it.

## DEVELOPMENT
- Be sure to run the server first
- `yarn dev`

## GRAPHQL TOOLS

- `yarn inspector:validate` see if all queries are done correctly
- `yarn inspector:coverage` see what types from the schema are actually used in this application
